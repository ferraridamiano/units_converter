# 1.1.0
In this release we added a complete `CustomConversion` definition. You are not anymore tied to `SimpleCustomConversion`! Check it out in the updated README. We also simplified all the code!

# 1.0.0
`units_converter` is stable since some releases. In this first 1.x version we made a huge work to improve the algorithm
conversion. Now it is **2x faster** then the previous one and it is simpler (less line of code with known algorithms).
We added more test, the **code coverage is now 100%**.
This release will not break anything, it is compatible with the previous one.

# 0.4.1
Added hectoPascal. Added a bunch of other test (99% code coverage). Minor bug fix (non-critical).

# 0.4.0
Breaking. In this release we used the `lints` package and changed enum to camelCase. We also added minutes/kilometer and
energy foot pounds units.

# 0.3.0+1
Added mils.

# 0.3.0

# 0.2.0+1

# 0.2.0
